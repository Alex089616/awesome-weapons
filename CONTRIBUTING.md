# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! But please note that this is a collection of biased thoughts from everyone working on WED.

we will review any and all contributions. Here's the process:

1. Make an individual pull request for each suggestion and include a reason why it is awesome.
2. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve so unless a section is alphabetical, add the item at the end.
3. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.
